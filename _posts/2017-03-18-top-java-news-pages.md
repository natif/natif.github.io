As a Java developer I often receive a bunch of questions regarding top
news websites I read about Java development.
The time has come to share these with a broader audience.
Each of pages is going to have some explanation.

### 1. Reddit /r/java
This is the first page that I check in the morning. Lots of interesting
Java articles shared by Java developers. The most important thing about
this channel of news is that, it delivers diversity of articles.
I highly recommend you to put into yours daily routine checking
[reddit.com/r/java](https://reddit.com/r/java).

### 2. Java Code Geeks
Java Code Geeks is a website containing articles, newsletter
and learning parts dedicated to Java language. Apart from Java articles,
you can also find there a section about Agile and DevOps.

### 3. Java World
Java World is a similar page to Java Code Geeks.
Java World also provides me with daily articles, contains a newsletter
and learning section. Good quality of articles and whitepapers makes
Java World one of my top four Java websites.

### 4. InfoQ Java
InfoQ’s Java section brings the most value to me from watching Java
related videos. However, InfoQ’s Java section also present Java related articles.
These are my top Java news websites. Please share yours in the comments section!
